# HTML Glossary for Beginners

## Why Use Semantic Tags?
Semantic tags such as `<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` do not change the visual appearance of your site by themselves, but they provide meaning and structure to your HTML. This helps:
- **Accessibility:** Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret your content.
- **SEO:** Search engines understand your page structure, improving search rankings.
- **Maintainability:** Code is easier to read and maintain for you and others.
- **Consistency:** Encourages best practices and standards in web development.
