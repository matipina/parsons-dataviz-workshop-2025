# HTML Glossary for Beginners

Welcome to HTML! This glossary is designed for new students in the Parsons Data Viz Summer Workshop. It introduces the most important HTML elements and concepts you'll use to build web pages. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every website, providing structure and meaning to your content.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that uses tags to describe the structure of web pages. Tags tell the browser how to display text, images, links, and other content. Learning HTML is the first step to creating your own websites.

## Why Use Semantic Tags?

Semantic tags such as `<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` do not change the visual appearance of your site by themselves, but they provide meaning and structure to your HTML. This helps:

- **Accessibility:** Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret your content.
- **SEO:** Search engines understand your page structure, improving search rankings.
- **Maintainability:** Code is easier to read and maintain for you and others.
- **Consistency:** Encourages best practices and standards in web development.

## Essential HTML Elements

- Semantic tags help assistive technologies understand page structure.
- Consider using `aria-*` attributes for advanced accessibility (e.g., `aria-label`).

## Best Practices

- Use semantic tags for meaning, not just layout.
- Write readable, well-indented code.
- Add comments using `<!-- comment -->`.
- Keep HTML organized and avoid unnecessary nesting.
